# Iranian-Cars-Price-Prediction

This repository presents the code for preprocessing cars dataset and prediction cars price.

The dataset represent tabular information about cars from several brands at several different manufacturing times and their price in Iran in different Time periods.
This dataset collected from https://divar.ir and uploaded in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianghasemi/divar-cars

In the first section of the code, the preprocessing and cleaning of data, consist of handling out-of-bounds data, missing value, checking outlier and ect was done. 

After that several models consist of Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, KNN, Decision Tree and ensemble based models consist of RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor, LGBMRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor and also MLP model  were trained on data for creating a prediction model for predicting cars price.
